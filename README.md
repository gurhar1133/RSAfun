# RSAfun

This is a simple RSA crypto-system I made in a discrete math course. I had a lot of fun with this project and learned 
quite a bit about the math behind cryptography. It also learned about number theory as well. It was really great seeing
how seemingly esoteric math has such a powerful practical application. I decided split this into a lib file and a main
file for playing around with the functions.
