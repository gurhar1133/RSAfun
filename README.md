# RSAfun

This is a simple RSA crypto-system I made in a discrete math course. I decided to expand on it a little with some 
factoring and code breaking functions. I had a lot of fun with this project and learned quite a bit about the math 
behind cryptography. It also learned about number theory as well. It was really great seeing how seemingly esoteric 
math has such a powerful practical application.
